# Name-Abbreviation

This project is designed to generate unique three-letter abbreviations for a list of names, adhering to some specific rules as outlined by the course instructor. The primary challenges included to ensure abbreviations are: 1. Formed from the first letter of the name followed by two additional letters in order. 2. Unique across all names in the list. 3. Scored and selected based on predefined positional and frequency rules. This report outlines the programâ€™s structure, the problem-solving approach, and the validation process used to ensure its accuracy.
